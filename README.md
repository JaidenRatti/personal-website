[University notes](https://github.com/JaidenRatti/university-notes) are converted from .tex to .html via [TeX4ht](https://tug.org/tex4ht/) (Courses with code use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html)). MathJax rasterizes the $\LaTeX$ $\implies$ right-clicking on aligned equations shows the $\LaTeX$ for that block!
